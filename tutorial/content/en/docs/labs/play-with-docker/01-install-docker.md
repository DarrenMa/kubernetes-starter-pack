## Install Docker Engine

Open the terminal and run the following commands listed below.

1. Change directory to the previously cloned repository directory:

    ```sh
    cd ~/kubernetes-starter-pack/install
    ```

2. Launch the installation script which will follow the [repository installation method](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository):

    ```sh
    ./docker-install.sh
    ```

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated." />}}

3. Verify that you can interact with the Docker Engine:

    ```sh
    docker ps
    ```

## Explore network interfaces

```sh
ip addr show
```

You should see a newly `docker0` interface with ip address `172.17.0.1` created by Docker. This is the virtual bridge used to forward data traffic to containers attached to it.

## Explore network routes

```sh
ip route
```

You should see a newly route created by Docker that states that all traffic directed to subnet `172.17.0.0/16` (where containers will reside by default; Docker daemon acts as a DHCP server) must go to the `docker0` interface.
